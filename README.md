Testing PR comments

Before you submit your review, your line comments are pending and only visible to you. You can edit pending comments anytime before you submit your review. To cancel a pending review, including all of its pending comments, click Review changes above the changed code, then click Abandon review.

GitHub Copilot can help you quickly understand the changes in a pull request by providing context and explanations for specific commits. If you’re unsure about the purpose of a particular change or need more details about how it fits into the broader codebase, you can ask Copilot questions about individual commits.
